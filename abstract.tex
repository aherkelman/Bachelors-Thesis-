Path planning is a crucial part of controlling a robotic manipulator. To move in an unknown environment sensors must be utilized for generating workspace information. In this report an A start based path planning algorithm was implemented for a four degree of freedom manipulator. A three dimensional camera was used to locate the goal and obstacles within the manipulators workspace. The results of real world implementation, modeling and the theory behind them are discussed.
